Hi, I'll try to share my knowledge and thing I'm currently working on. 
Mostly technical bullshit, even more buzzwords, but should always be related to some knowledge

Currently you can take a peek into:
- [Running libspotify on Raspberry PI Zero and utilizing old BT Speaker to make it smart][raspotify]
- [Scripts to simplify running any version of multi node kubernetes cluster using VirtualBox][k8sonbox]

[raspotify]: https://github.com/kirek007/braindump/tree/master/raspotify
[k8sonbox]: https://github.com/kirek007/braindump/tree/master/k8s-hell
